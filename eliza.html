	<h2>College</h2>
	  <p>Hi my name is Eliza. I am currently a <b>freshman</b> and I attend <b>Brooklyn College</b>. I <i>really</i> like it so far. I'm learning how to code in my <b>Computing and Quantitative Reasoning</b> class. My professor taught me how to code this very webpage. I am <i>thrilled</i> to learn more about coding as well as becoming confident in my ability to do so.</p>
